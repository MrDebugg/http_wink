# http_wink
http_wink is a Script that screenshots all Subdomain/Domain Pages.

Why?

Because i think going through a massive list of subdomains and checking each one for importance takes too much time
So why not automate this boring process.

Usage:

    python http_wink.py <SUBSLIST>
    
Sample Output:
   
    .__     __    __                   .__        __
    |  |___/  |__/  |_______   __  _  _|__| ____ |  | __
    |  |  \   __\   __\____ \  \ \/ \/ /  |/    \|  |/ /
    |   Y  \  |  |  | |  |_> >  \     /|  |   |  \    <
    |___|  /__|  |__| |   __/____\/\_/ |__|___|  /__|_ \
         \/           |__| /_____/             \/     \/
